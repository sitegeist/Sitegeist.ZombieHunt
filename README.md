## Settings

The zombification and destruction period can be defined via settings. By default hidden contents that have not been touched for
a year will turn to zombie-content and are due to destruction after another year. 

```yaml
Sitegeist:
  ZombieHunt:
    # hidden contents turn to zombie-content after this period
    zombificationPeriod: 31536000

    # zombie-contents have to be destructed after this period
    destructionPeriod: 31536000
```

## Neos Backend

In the document-tree and content-structure zombie nodes are marked with "ğŸ§Ÿ" resp. "ğŸ”¥ğŸ§ŸğŸ”¥" for zombie-contents that are due to destruction.
In addition zombie-contents are marked also in the backend rendering.

```shell
./flow zombie:detect

```shell
./flow zombie:destroy
```
